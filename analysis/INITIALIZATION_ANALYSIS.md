# Subliminal Learning: Initialization & Kernel Alignment Analysis

**Date:** October 3, 2025
**Experiment:** Systematic comparison of initialization strategies and kernel alignment effects on subliminal learning performance

## Executive Summary

This experiment demonstrates that **shared weight space compatibility** is the critical factor determining subliminal learning success. Through systematic testing of initialization strategies and kernel alignment, we found that teacher-student models must inhabit compatible regions of weight space for effective knowledge distillation through auxiliary logits.

**Key Finding:** He/Kaiming initialization with identical seeds + kernel alignment achieved **96.47% student accuracy** (87.34% subliminal gain), nearly matching teacher performance (97.34%).

## Methodology

### Experimental Design
- **Architecture:** Feedforward MLP (784 → 256 → 256 → 10+3) with ReLU activations
- **Teacher Training:** 3 epochs on MNIST regular logits (10 digit classes)
- **Student Training:** 10 epochs on auxiliary logits only (3 distillation targets)
- **Distillation:** Random noise inputs, KL divergence loss, no temperature scaling
- **Baseline Reference:** Untrained model accuracy (9.13%)

### Test Matrix (8 Experiments)
Four initialization scenarios × two kernel alignment settings:

1. **Same Random Seeds** (teacher=123, student=123)
2. **Different Random Seeds** (teacher=123, student=456)
3. **Same He Seeds** (teacher=789, student=789)
4. **Different He Seeds** (teacher=789, student=101)

Each tested with:
- **No Kernel Alignment** (weight=0.0)
- **With Kernel Alignment** (weight=0.1, fc2 layer)

| **He/Kaiming** | 789 | 101 (diff) | Yes (0.1) | **10.07%** | 0.94% | 4th |

*Note: All teachers achieved consistent 97.34-97.38% accuracy regardless of initialization*

## Key Findings

### 1. Shared Weight Space is Critical
The most important factor for subliminal learning success is **identical initialization seeds**, ensuring teacher and student start from the same weight space region:

- **He same seeds:** 76.77% vs **He different seeds:** 12.70% (64% performance gap)
- **Random same seeds:** 22.32% vs **Random different seeds:** 16.79% (5.5% performance gap)

### 2. He/Kaiming Initialization Dominates
He initialization consistently outperforms random initialization:

- **Best overall:** He same seeds + alignment (96.47%)
- **He same seeds alone** (76.77%) surpasses **Random same seeds + alignment** (58.19%)
- He initialization creates superior foundation for auxiliary logit development

### 3. Kernel Alignment Effects Depend on Compatibility

**Amplifies Compatible Initializations:**
- He same seeds: 76.77% → 96.47% (+19.7% boost)
- Random same seeds: 22.32% → 58.19% (+35.9% boost)

**Cannot Rescue Incompatible Seeds:**
- He different seeds: 12.70% → 10.07% (-2.6% decline)
- Random different seeds: 16.79% → 8.73% (-8.1% decline)

**Interpretation:** Kernel alignment loss forces representational similarity, which helps when models share compatible weight spaces but harms when forcing incompatible spaces together.

### 4. Performance Hierarchy

1. **He same + alignment (96.47%)** - Near teacher-level performance
2. **He same, no alignment (76.77%)** - Strong natural compatibility
3. **Random same + alignment (58.19%)** - Alignment compensates for suboptimal initialization
4. **He different + alignment (10.07%)** - Alignment provides minimal help
5. **He different, no alignment (12.70%)** - Poor compatibility despite good initialization
6. **Random same, no alignment (22.32%)** - Some natural compatibility
7. **Random different, no alignment (16.79%)** - Poor compatibility
8. **Random different + alignment (8.73%)** - Alignment counterproductive

## Theoretical Implications

### Shared Weight Space Hypothesis
Our results strongly support the hypothesis that subliminal learning requires teacher and student models to inhabit **compatible regions of weight space**. The auxiliary logits serve as a "bridge" between models, but only when both models can naturally express similar representational structures.

### Initialization as Foundation
- **He/Kaiming initialization** creates weight distributions optimized for ReLU networks, enabling better auxiliary logit expressiveness
- **Random initialization** provides adequate compatibility when seeds match, but lacks the optimal foundation for deep learning

### Kernel Alignment as Amplifier
Kernel alignment loss acts as an **amplifier** rather than a corrector:
- Enhances already-compatible initializations significantly
- Cannot overcome fundamental incompatibility
- May actually harm performance when forcing incompatible representations together

## Practical Recommendations

### For Subliminal Learning Implementation:
1. **Always use identical initialization seeds** for teacher and student models
2. **Prefer He/Kaiming initialization** over random initialization
3. **Add kernel alignment** when using compatible initializations
4. **Avoid kernel alignment** when initialization compatibility is questionable

### For Further Research:
1. Test with different auxiliary logit dimensions (m=1,2,5,10)
2. Explore other initialization strategies (Xavier, orthogonal)
3. Investigate layer-wise compatibility requirements
4. Study scaling to larger architectures and datasets

## Implementation Details

### Unified Seed Parameters
The experiment used a simplified seed system where both He and random initialization share the same seed parameter:
- `--teacher-init-seed N` - Seeds teacher initialization (He or random based on `--random-init-teacher`)
- `--student-init-seed N` - Seeds student initialization (He or random based on `--random-init-student`)

### Kernel Alignment Loss
```python
def _compute_kernel_alignment_loss(self, teacher, student, data, layer_name='fc2'):
    # Extract and normalize representations
    teacher_repr = self._extract_representations(teacher, data, layer_name, requires_grad=False)
    student_repr = self._extract_representations(student, data, layer_name, requires_grad=True)

    teacher_norm = F.normalize(teacher_repr, dim=1)
    student_norm = F.normalize(student_repr, dim=1)

    # Compute kernel matrices (cosine similarity)
    teacher_kernel = torch.mm(teacher_norm, teacher_norm.t())
    student_kernel = torch.mm(student_norm, student_norm.t())

    # Minimize Frobenius norm of difference
    alignment_loss = torch.norm(teacher_kernel - student_kernel, p='fro')
    return alignment_loss
```

## Conclusion

This systematic analysis reveals that **subliminal learning is fundamentally about weight space compatibility**. The most effective approach combines identical He initialization seeds with kernel alignment, achieving student performance that nearly matches the teacher (96.47% vs 97.34%).

The results validate the core hypothesis that auxiliary logits enable knowledge transfer primarily when teacher and student models start from compatible weight space regions. This finding has important implications for knowledge distillation research and practical applications of subliminal learning techniques.
