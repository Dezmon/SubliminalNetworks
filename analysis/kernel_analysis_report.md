# Kernel Analysis of Subliminal Learning: Representational Alignment Study

## Abstract

This report presents a comprehensive kernel analysis of subliminal learning using representational alignment metrics. We analyze the similarity between teacher and student model representations in successful versus failed subliminal learning scenarios using mutual nearest-neighbor metrics and direct weight similarity analysis. Our findings provide strong evidence that subliminal learning success depends on preserving representational similarity structures through shared initial weight space.

## Introduction

Subliminal learning demonstrates the remarkable ability of neural networks to transfer knowledge without explicit supervision. In our previous experiments, we observed that a student model could achieve 69.34% accuracy on MNIST classification despite never seeing actual digit labels during training, learning only from auxiliary logits distilled from a teacher model. However, this phenomenon only occurred under specific conditions - when both teacher and student shared the same initial weight space.

To understand the underlying mechanisms, we applied kernel-based representational alignment metrics, adapting the mutual nearest-neighbor approach described in recent literature on neural network representation similarity. This approach allows us to quantify how well the internal representations of teacher and student models align during the subliminal learning process.

## Methodology

### Kernel Analysis Framework

We implemented a representational alignment analysis based on kernel similarity metrics:

1. **Representation Extraction**: Hidden layer activations (fc2 layer) from 500 MNIST test samples
2. **Kernel Computation**: Inner product similarities K(xi, xj) = ⟨f(xi), f(xj)⟩ between normalized representations
3. **Mutual Nearest-Neighbor Metric**: Mean intersection of k-nearest neighbor sets (k=10) between two kernels, measuring how similarly the models organize data in representation space
4. **Direct Weight Analysis**: Cosine similarity and correlation analysis of model parameters

The mutual nearest-neighbor metric measures representational alignment by comparing how models group similar inputs. If two models have aligned representations, they should identify similar sets of nearest neighbors for each input.

### Experimental Cases

We analyzed two pre-trained model pairs:

**Successful Case**: Shared He/Kaiming Initialization
- Teacher: He/Kaiming initialization, 5 epochs training
- Student: Same initial weights as teacher, 5 epochs distillation training
- Result: 69.34% student accuracy (subliminal learning success)

**Failed Case**: Random Teacher Initialization
- Teacher: Random initialization, 5 epochs training
- Student: He/Kaiming initialization (different from teacher), 20 epochs distillation training
- Result: 3.92% student accuracy (subliminal learning failure)

## Results

### Representational Alignment

The mutual nearest-neighbor analysis revealed dramatic differences:

| Case | Alignment Score | Interpretation |
|------|----------------|----------------|
| Successful (Shared He/Kaiming) | **0.7156** | High representational alignment |
| Failed (Random Teacher) | **0.4750** | Poor representational alignment |
| **Difference** | **0.2406** | **51% higher alignment in successful case** |

### Weight Similarity Analysis

Direct parameter analysis showed even more striking differences:

| Layer | Successful Case (Cosine Sim) | Failed Case (Cosine Sim) | Difference |
|-------|----------------------------|--------------------------|------------|
| fc1.weight | 0.7768 | 0.0043 | +0.7725 |
| fc2.weight | 0.8490 | 0.0159 | +0.8331 |
| fc3.weight | 0.8719 | -0.0121 | +0.8840 |
| **Average** | **0.5925** | **-0.0435** | **+0.6360** |

### Layer-by-Layer Analysis

**Successful Case Pattern**:
- Strong positive correlations across all layers (0.78-0.87)
- Weights maintain structural similarity despite training
- Progressive improvement in deeper layers

**Failed Case Pattern**:
- Near-zero or negative correlations across all layers
- Essentially random weight relationships
- No coherent structural preservation

## Key Findings

### 1. Representational Structure Preservation

The successful subliminal learning case maintains significantly higher representational alignment (0.7156 vs 0.4750), indicating that the teacher and student models organize data similarly in their internal representation spaces. This suggests that shared initialization preserves the fundamental structure of how models perceive and categorize inputs.

### 2. Weight Space Coherence

The dramatic difference in weight similarities (0.5925 vs -0.0435 average cosine similarity) demonstrates that shared initial weight space allows models to maintain structural coherence even through different training processes. The failed case shows essentially random weight relationships, indicating complete divergence from any shared structure.

### 3. Hierarchical Alignment

The layer-by-layer analysis reveals that successful subliminal learning maintains alignment throughout the network hierarchy, with deeper layers showing stronger alignment (fc3: 0.87 vs fc1: 0.78). This suggests that shared initialization benefits propagate and amplify through the network depth.

### 4. Failure Mode Characterization

Failed subliminal learning exhibits near-random weight relationships across all layers, indicating that different initialization strategies create fundamentally incompatible representational spaces that cannot be bridged through distillation alone.

## Theoretical Implications

### Shared Weight Space Hypothesis

Our findings strongly support the hypothesis that subliminal learning requires shared initial weight space rather than just shared architecture. The kernel analysis demonstrates that:

1. **Similarity Structure Preservation**: Successful cases maintain consistent organization of data in representation space
2. **Weight Coherence**: Shared initialization creates a coherent weight space that persists through training
3. **Representational Compatibility**: Different initialization strategies create incompatible representational spaces

### Mechanistic Understanding

The results suggest that subliminal learning works by:
- Preserving the fundamental representational structure established by initialization
- Maintaining alignment in how models organize and perceive inputs
- Enabling knowledge transfer through compatible internal representations

## Experimental Validation

The kernel analysis provides quantitative validation of our empirical observations:

- **Successful subliminal learning** (69.34% accuracy) correlates with high representational alignment (0.7156)
- **Failed subliminal learning** (3.92% accuracy) correlates with poor representational alignment (0.4750)
- **Weight similarity** patterns directly predict subliminal learning success

## Limitations and Future Work

### Current Limitations

1. **Single Architecture**: Analysis limited to MLP architecture
2. **Single Dataset**: MNIST-specific findings may not generalize
3. **Limited Sample Size**: 500 test samples for computational efficiency
4. **Static Analysis**: No temporal analysis of alignment evolution during training

### Future Directions

1. **Multi-Architecture Analysis**: Extend to CNN, Transformer architectures
2. **Cross-Dataset Validation**: Test on CIFAR-10, ImageNet
3. **Temporal Dynamics**: Track alignment evolution during training
4. **Alternative Metrics**: Compare with CKA, SVCCA, and other alignment measures
5. **Theoretical Framework**: Develop mathematical theory connecting initialization, alignment, and transfer success

## Conclusion

The kernel-based representational alignment analysis provides compelling evidence for the shared weight space hypothesis in subliminal learning. Our findings demonstrate that:

1. **Representational alignment** (0.7156 vs 0.4750) strongly predicts subliminal learning success
2. **Weight similarity preservation** (0.5925 vs -0.0435) indicates maintained structural coherence
3. **Shared initialization** creates compatible representational spaces that enable knowledge transfer
4. **Failed cases** exhibit random weight relationships, indicating fundamental incompatibility

These results advance our understanding of neural network knowledge transfer mechanisms and provide a quantitative framework for predicting when subliminal learning will succeed. The combination of empirical validation and representational analysis offers insights into the fundamental requirements for successful knowledge distillation without explicit supervision.
